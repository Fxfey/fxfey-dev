# Portfolio Client

Welcome to the codebase behind my personal portfolio client - a Next.js project thatâ€™s more than just a showcase. Itâ€™s an evolving experiment, a space where I push boundaries, explore new stacks, and craft tools that reflect how I work and what I value as a developer.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This isnâ€™t just another portfolio site. When I set out to build it, I challenged myself to dive into an entirely new tech stack and build something **truly functional** - not just pretty.

### âœ¨ Key Features

-   **Next.js Frontend**
    The site is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for fast performance, flexibility, and modern frontend capabilities.

-   **Custom Headless CMS (Work in Progress)**
    Rather than relying on off-the-shelf CMS solutions, I'm building a **bespoke CMS from scratch** using Wordpress. This CMS will serve as a headless backend, giving me full control over content, structure, and integrations.

-   **Steam Web API Integration**
    Displays real time game statistics by tapping into the [Steam Web API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API).

-   **Spotify API Integration**
    Pulls in real-time listening data from [Spotify's Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), making the portfolio more personal and dynamic.

## ðŸ§± Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
-   **APIs:** Steam Web API, Spotify Web API
-   **Backend (Planned):** Wordpress (as a headless CMS)
-   **Hosting:** Vercel (for frontend)
